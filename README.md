## Task: Implement a Simple Login Form

You are provided with a basic Vite application. Your task is to implement a simple login form. You may use any libraries you prefer for form handling and HTTP requests.

### Requirements
- The login form must include three fields:
  - **Email** (text input)
  - **Password** (password input)
  - **Planet** (dropdown with a list of planets in the solar system)
- All fields are required. Implement validation to ensure no field is left empty.
- When the form is submitted:
  - Disable and gray out all fields and buttons to indicate submission is in progress.
  - Process the HTTP request and display the result (success or error) to the user.

### Bonus (Optional)
- After a successful login, redirect the user to a secure route.
- Prevent unauthorized users from accessing the secure route.

### Notes
- Focus on providing a good user experience and clean, maintainable code.
- Isn't necessary a pretty UI.
- You are free to structure the project and select libraries as you see fit.
